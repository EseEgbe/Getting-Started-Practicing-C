# Getting Started Practicing C
My personal journey in practicing the **C programming language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on VS Code
* Styling is adopted from CS50 style guide

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [`GuessingGame.c`](GuessingGame.c) | Program that allows a user to `guess a number` |
| [`RightTriangle.c`](RightTriangle.c) | Program that calculates the `hypotenus` of a right triangle |
